# PAI OOP Principles Project (2024-2025)

This project focuses on **programming best practices and object-oriented design principles** using **TypeScript**.

This repository includes: 
- The slides of the presentation
- Coding examples

## OOP Concepts Covered

- `Encapsulation`: Demonstrates data protection using access modifiers.
- `Composition`: Builds complex objects from simpler components.
- `Delegation`: Shows how objects pass tasks to others.
- `Inheritance`: Highlights code reuse through hierarchies.
- `Polymorphism`: Presents multiple behaviors through shared interfaces.
- `Abstraction`: Simplifies logic using abstract classes and interfaces.

## Design Principles Demonstrated

- `K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple, Stupid)`: Emphasizes simplicity in code.
- `D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself)`: Promotes logic reuse to avoid redundancy.
- `Y.A.G.N.I(You Aren't Going to Need It)`: Focuses on building only essential features.

## Best Practices Highlighted

- Identifies common `code smells` and their impact.
- Applies `refactoring techniques` to enhance code quality.
- Integrates insights from `Clean Code` and `97 things Every Programmer Should Know`
